# BATTLESHIP WARS

Battleship wars is a game that is based on the classic strategy pen and paper game where the 2 players fight for victory 
by destroying each other's ships. This version of the game is a python based game played via the terminal inside a code 
editor, or in this case this game is depolyed on Heroku which creates a terminal to play on.

Players will be playing against a computer that will try to find all of the players ships before they do, 
the first to lose all of his ships loses the game. There are 4 ships in total with 4 different sizes going from 
a ship that occupies 2 rows/collums to a ship that occupies 5.

## How to play

Inside the terminal the first thing the player will see is how to play the game. Here it explains 
what all different symbols mean. The players ships are indicated with a *, the empty spots are indicated with [ ], 
the misses with o and the hits with an X. In turns the player and computer get a shot at each other, the player
chooses hir/hers shots by typing in the coordinates (example: B5/h7) The first who sinks all of the oponents ships
wins the game and can after enter 'y' to go again or 'n' to stop playing.
